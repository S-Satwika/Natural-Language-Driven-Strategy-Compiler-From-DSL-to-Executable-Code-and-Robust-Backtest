# NL-DSL-Code-An-End-to-End-System-for-Quant-Strategy-Simulation
This project is a modular, end-to-end strategy compiler that translates a Natural Language (NL) rule through a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) into executable Python code. The core function is to run a robust backtest that accurately calculates Total Return and the critical Max Drawdown (MDD) by tracking daily unrealized equity.
